Hi. I'm Chris. I'm doing a thing. This thing already had a name before I did it. they called it being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad">digital nomad</a>.

I'd like to think I had the idea swirling about in my mind before "digital nomad" entered the zeitgeist. Not in any sense of trying to brag. I think that's a common sort of experience, not unlike my friend who had the idea of a "automatic cat box cleaner" before he realized such a thing existed.

But "digital nomad" is a thing, and I do find it terribly convenient to trot it out as an explanation whenever anyone asks what on earth it is I'm doing. I also find it to be an incredible gift that so many others are doing something so similar, such that there's now infrastructure for it; so that I can go to the quiet island of <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Ko+Lanta+District,+Krabi/@7.6275988,98.980313,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x304e0246980f7461:0x30223bc2c367f90!8m2!3d7.6243677!4d99.0792263">Ko Lanta</a> in rural Thailand, and fully expect blazing-fast wifi and all the other trappings one needs to get work done, courtesy of the folks at <a href="http://www.kohub.org">Kohub</a>.

My point in making this distinction is that as I begin, I aim to keep distinct these two approaches, the one I've held in my mind, and the one that's evolved out there in the world. Because as the conveniences and practicality borne of the latter are things of value, so too is the uniqueness of the former. Writing about it helps me remember it, and also to forge it and define it.

I started by turning down some fairly lucrative freelancing work - at least for the first quarter.  Instead, I'm hiring myself, to work on projects of my own design. Luckily, I can hire myself for very cheap; the places I'll be staying in the first few months - Thailand, Bali, Vietnam, are inexpensive enough to make that the case.

My aim is to be working on my own projects. Two, in particular: One that's a goal, a dream, a sincere desire to create something that shakes up the world. And two, a more modest goal, practical in its aims, the process of creating which should give me most of the skills I need to do the former. 

What's this blog for, then? A place to hold all the words and pictures that come along the way. Perhaps totally unmarketable, and that's fine. A lot of what I'm doing is meant to be incredibly marketable, so this will be the exception. If you're reading this, you're probably someone I know in real life anyway. 

I'm feeling like this is getting terribly long-winded, and my stomach is rumbling at me to go down the street for a lovely breakfast, and otherwise get ready for the day. See you in the next post.

Ah, Lanta. I'll be living here for nearly two months. Among other things, this is where I start really working. Except this time, I'm working for myself, creating a business from scratch.

<h1>The Bungalow</h1>

The bungalow above is my home for the next month. I love it. 5 minute walk to the beach, 3 minutes by scooter to the coworking space. $600 for the month (utilities and housekeeping inclusive) so I won't be going broke anytime soon. Close to restraunts, bars, shops, and a 7-11.  

<h1>Kohub</h1>

<a href="http://www.kohub.org/">Kohub</a> is fantastic as expected. Bigger and more expansive than I thought. Plenty of room, quiet, but also community events, meeting my fellow digital nomads. It's a place I've already been able to get a lot of work done and will get a lot more done in the month ahead.

<h1>So What's it Like?</h1>

I have a short answer and a long answer.

Short answer is, it's pretty fucking awesome. Living and working in a tropical paradise. No boss, no meetings, and a clear goal with all my working efforts directed towards it. 

Long answer is, I find it incredibly hard to describe. It reminds me of a quote...

>“Those whose strength lies in the depth impressions make on them - they are usually called deep men... are when they encounter the unexpected relatively calm and resolved: for at the first moment the impression was still shallow, only then did it *become* deep. <br><br>Long foreseen and expected things and people, on the other hand, excite such natures the most, and when such things finally do arrive their presence of mind almost deserts them.” <cite>― Friedrich Nietzsche</cite>

 
It's still hard to wrap my head around. Doing this is something I'd held in mind vaguely for some years, and as a concrete plan I was working towards for about eight months. And so it's hard to describe, as it's no longer a tightly confined thing, a "concept" in the grid of the mind- it's a real, sprawling, breathing, messy, sticky, spiraling, cascading, awesome reality.

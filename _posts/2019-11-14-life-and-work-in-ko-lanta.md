Ah, Lanta. I'll be living here for nearly two months. Among other things, this is where I start really working. Except this time, I'm working for myself, creating a business from scratch. 

<h1>The Bungalow</h1>

The bungalow above is my home for the next month. I love it. 5 minute walk to the beach, 3 minutes by scooter to the coworking space. $600 for the month (utilities and housekeeping inclusive) so I won't be going broke anytime soon. Close to restraunts, bars, shops, and a 7-11.

<h1>Kohub</h1>

<a href="http://www.kohub.org/">Kohub</a> is fantastic as expected. Bigger and more expansive than I thought. Plenty of room, quiet, but also community events, meeting my fellow digital nomads. A place I've already been able to get a lot of work done and will get a lot more done in the month ahead.

<h1>The Scooter</h1>

I rented a scooter, and it's opened up the whole island, and is fun as hell to boot. Explored a lot of places, and many more to come. It was also terrifying at first, though that's simmered down to a modest level of fear that's healthily conducive to vigilant, defensive driving. The big rural roads are pretty forgiving to a newbie, I'm glad I'm not cutting my teeth on riding in a giant city. 


<h1>So What's it Like?</h1>

I have a short answer and a long answer.

Short answer is, it's pretty fucking awesome. Living and working in a tropical paradise. No boss, no meetings, and a clear goal with all my working efforts directed towards it. 

Long answer is, I find it incredibly hard to describe. It's still hard to wrap my head around. Doing this is something I'd held in mind vaguely for some years, and as a concrete plan I was working towards for about eight months. And so it's hard to describe, as it's no longer a tightly confined thing, a "concept" in the grid of the mind- it's a real, sprawling, breathing, messy, sticky, spiraling, cascading, awesome reality.

I'd been meaning to post a more general overview of impressions of Saigon, a place I've grown quite fond of. But for now, it seems appropriate share an update on where the current global crisis has found me for anyone out there who might be wondering.

A few days ago, the US State Department <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/19/politics/state-department-travel-advisory/index.html">told Americans overseas</a> to "arrange for immediate return to the United States, unless they are prepared to remain abroad for an indefinite period."

I've decided to go with the latter option. I'm not thrilled about the idea of getting on a plane right now, and if I'm back in the States I'm either a significant risk vector for folks there, especially my parents- or else I don't see them, which renders moot a lot of the reasons to go back. I also realized that getting even a barebones health insurance policy while I'm there would cost about two-thirds what I'm currently paying in rent (my current insurance covers me here, but only for a max of 15 consecutive days in the USA.)

Meanwhile, with only around 100 confirmed cases here in Vietnam so far, and life being- if not quite "normal," certainly a lot closer to "normal" than it is most places- I've decided to stay where I am.

The picture at the top of this post is a view I've seen a lot of- I'm in a nice comfy apartment across the street from a park.

I face the same uncertainties as most people do, and those are compounded by being in a foreign land. But I've got enough resources to stay here for the foreseeable future, so I'm grateful to be in the position I'm in overall. 

Hope you all are staying safe out there.

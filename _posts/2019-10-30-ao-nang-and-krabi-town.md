In Ao Nang and Krabi town, Thailand. You really feel a difference in when you hit Southern Thailand. The pace is slower, more relaxed. There's a large muslim population, so you see headscarves and hear prayer calls and see mosques, along with the requisite Buddhist temples.

Ao Nang's a classic beach town, with a bit less hustle and bustle than Phuket.

I did a little bit of work, a bit of sightseeing, mainly just settling in. I started to forget which day of the week it was, which is a feeling i hadn't had in years.
